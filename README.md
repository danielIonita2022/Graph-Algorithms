# Graph Algorithms

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to showcase various graph algorithms studied during a university course with the help of a user interface made in Java Swing.

## Technologies used

Java and Java Swing.

## Features

1. Draw a graph with nodes and edges.
2. Solve a maze with the BFS algorithm.
3. Draw the graph and obtain the minimum cost partial tree using Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm.
